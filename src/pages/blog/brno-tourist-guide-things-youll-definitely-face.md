If you're reading this, I suppose you're going to Brno sometime soon. I'm writing this for all of my friends that (I hope) eventually will visit me. If you've never met me online or in person, keep reading anyway — hope you'll find something useful.

## 1. Getting here
There are a couple of ways to arrive to Brno using civil transportation: you can come by the plane, by train or by bus.

### Plane

### Train

### Bus

## 2. Getting around here

Buy a ticket in the vending machines

## 3. Food
I feel like Czech people hate vegetables: that's why they fry them or just don't add them to their meals.
