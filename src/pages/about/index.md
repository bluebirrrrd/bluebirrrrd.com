Hi again!

I'm Anna Kurylo, a Ukrainian person living in the Czech Republic. My day job is software engineering (I currently work for a cool company called Red Hat), and in my spare time I love to travel, explore new things, and occasionally just to lie on the couch binging Netflix.

This blog is my side project and attempt to make a blog on my own, without using Wordpress. If you're interested in how it's built, check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/bluebirrrrd/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms).

I don't expect this blog to have regular updates, so if you're interested to learn more about my life, check out my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/bluebirrrrd) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bluebirrrrd).

P.S. This is a first version of this page. Eventually I hope to get my photo here, but who knows when that may happen :)
